# Final_Project
A model for the total energy consumption and emissions of internet applications
The aim of the project is to create a model for the total energy consumption, and the resulting emissions o greenhouse gases, of internet applications (client+network+server). There are two main components: electricity consumption during operation and energy required for production of the servers, clients, routers etc.
