# Final_Project
A model for the total energy consumption and emissions of internet applications
The aim of the project is to create a model for the total energy consumption, and the resulting emissions o greenhouse gases, of internet applications (client+network+server). There are two main components: electricity consumption during operation and energy required for production of the servers, clients, routers etc.

* One question is if this assumption is correct. In fact, both the data centre and the network will consume electricity even if there is no data transmission, because even when all servers and routers are idle, they still consume electricity. Can this be ignored? If not, you need to include it.

* What is not part of this model is the carbon cost of building the data centres and network infrastructure, the production of servers and routers in the data centre, the production of transmitters, receivers, switches and routers in the network. You should definitely include that.

* The model also does not include the carbon cost of the end user: modem, wifi router, desktop or laptop, monitor, mobile devices etc, both production and utilisation. Maybe the electricity for utilisation could be ignored, if it is small, but you would have to show that; but the electricity for production of the devices cannot be ignored, so you should include that.
